            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p id = "p-About" class = "p-Text">As tough as it is to talk about one, I also want to show the world my worthiness and value for society by bringing my technology and software skills to knowledge.
        I believe that mankind can get to the point in which we all colaborate together and enhance the knowledge we still have not discovered from the vast Universe we live in. Because of those beliefs
        I want to devote my whole life to cooperate, connect, learn and build wonders with people all around the world heading to a better and more evolved humanity.

        That is amongst many reasons, why I learned and continue learning languages. Not only to comunicate with computers. Thanks to the experience acquired 
        with different companies, I've been able to identify the different needs and gaps in software development, weather is for big organizations or startups.

        My main focus is to develop hybrid applications that work in several operative systems. With that in mind I have learned and certified my knowledge in Flutter development
        as well as in JavaScript, HTML&CSS
